### While loops
##
### Syntax :
##    while condition:
##        statement1
##        statement2
##    else:
##        statement3
##        statementn
### Premature termination of a while loop using break
### break : As soon as the program execution flow comes to break inside a while loop ( or any other loop),the loop will be immediatly left.
### continue: continue stops the current iterration of loop and starts the next iteration by checkinig the condition.
##
### If a loop is left by a break else part is not executed.
