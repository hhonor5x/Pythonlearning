##In Python there are 6 sequence data types
##1. strings
##2. byte sequence
##3. byte arrays
##4. lists
##5. tuples
##6. range objects
##
##Items or elements of strings, lists and tuples are ordered in a defined sequence.
##Elements can be accessed via indices
##
##same syntax and function name can be used for sequential data types

str= "this is string"
print("length of string str is:",len(str))

lst=["one", "two", "three", "four"]
print("length of list lst is:", len(lst))

tup=("t1", "t2", "t3", "t4")
print("length of tuple tup is:", len(tup))


##A byte object is sequence of small integers. The element of byte object are in range 0 through 255, correcponding to ASCII characters and they are printed as such
